STEP 3: PREPARE SUGAR SYRUP
Put sugar and 1 cup water in a bowl and cook until sugar dissolves completely. Now check the sugar syrup. For this drop 1-2 drops on a plate. With help of your thumb and finger check the syrup. It should be gooey in texture. Formation of one thread or two thread is not necessary. Sugar syrup is now ready, turn off the flame. Add cardamom powder in the syrup and mix well. 

STEP 4: KNEAD THE MAWA

STEP 5: PREPARE GULAB JAMUN
Preheat oil in a pan. Take little amount of mixture and make a round ball and place it in pan for frying.Place 3-4 gulab jamuns in oil and fry. Keep in mind that while frying the gulab jamun doesn’t come in contact with the ladle. Take out the fried gulab jamun and place on plate with napkin paper.After 1-2 minutes, put in sugar syrup. Likewise prepare all gulab jamun. Let the gulab jamun drench in sugar syrup for 5-6 hours so that they get apt sweetness. 

SUGGESTIONS 
1)Don’t add too much maida in milk powder mawa, as doing so can make gulab jamun hard.
2)Before frying the gulab jamun, test them. For this fry one gulab jamun in oil, if it splits then add some maida into the mixture. 
3)If the gulab jamuns are getting hard, add 1-2 tsp milk into the mixture. Make sure while frying gulab jamun, oil is medium hot.
